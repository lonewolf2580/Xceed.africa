                                <p>It’s safe to say we are living in the future already and Artificial Intelligence has become so integral in society today and playing a much more important role in society presently.</p>
                                <p>Many traditional businesses are now digitally transforming and finding new ways in using Artificial Intelligence to improve their business processes.</p>
                                <p>Sadly, Africa hasn’t gotten started in this Artificial Intelligence race yet and there’s a huge risk of being left behind to other continents if we don’t begin to take active steps in becoming more aware of the power of Artificial Intelligence.</p>
                                <p>If you’re trying to understand more about Artificial Intelligence in the easiest way possible one book which we will recommend for you is the‘The Sentient Machine’ by Amir Husain</p>
                                <p>Why this book is pretty interesting is that Amir Husain discusses Artificial intelligence from the creation myth of Frankenstein to the advances made by technology innovators such as Elon Musk.</p>
                                <p>Amir Husain asks the essential question: What is the future for humanity in a world that is dominated by machines?</p>
                                <p>At Xceed one of our core missions is how we can apply Artificial Intelligence to businesses in Africa and we are more than happy to engage with anyone who is willing to have conversations regarding powering the African Economy using Artificial Intelligence</p>
